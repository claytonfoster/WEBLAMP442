Assignment 1 - Parts 1 and 2
============
This assignment provided a understanding of object oriented PHP as well as unit testing using PHPUnit.

                    Vehicle
                   /      \
                Car       Truck
                /
             Civic

What did I do?
============
- Implemented Three sub-classes: Car, Civic and Truck.
- Declared an interface named VehicleInterface, with a method called honk().
- Did not use abstract functions in Vehicle class since all the sub-classes were going to use the same setter and getter methods.
- Provided unit tests for each public function and class achieving 100% code coverage.
